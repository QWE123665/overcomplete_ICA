# Identifiability of overcomplete independent component analysis
Code, graphs and data associated to the paper: Identifiability of overcomplete independent component analysis.

SPM.py, helper_functions.py are the codes of the subspace power method from the paper: Subspace power method for symmetric tensor decomposition and generalized PCA by Joe Kileel, Jo√£o M. Pereira.

algorithm_related_functions.py is the code for the implementation of Algorithm 1 in our paper: Identifiability of overcomplete independent component analysis. 

The folder 'plots_data' contains the numerical data and plots shown in section 7 of our paper.
